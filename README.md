# Real-time Chat Application (REACT, Socket.io & HarperDB)
 A real time chat application using Node.js, Socket.io, React and Express. Built is following this tutorial from freeCodeCamp.org https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-realtime-chat-app-with-react-express-socketio-and-harperdb/#how-to-create-our-first-socket-io-event-listener-on-the-server.
 
The learning experience using REACT, Socket.io and HarperDB was really good during the tutorial and Danny described every step in detail following the tutorial. I have also added some preview photos under here to see a complete preview of the project running locally on my computer.
